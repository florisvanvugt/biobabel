# Biobabel : a unified interface for reading a plethora of physiology file formats

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/660740111.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/660740111)


Many different file formats exist for physiology signals such as cardiac (ECG, PPG) or respiratory data. Many packages exist in Python to read these formats but they load into different data structures. This package is a wrapper of sorts for already existing tools providing a unified easy-to-use interface.




# Installation

```
python3 -m pip install biobabel
```

Install latest development version from Github:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade "biobabel @ git+https://github.com/florisvanvugt/biobabel"
```

# Physiology dialects

Currently supported dialects for reading are:
* EDF through [PyEDFlib](https://pyedflib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* labstreaminglayer (LSL) XDF (alpha) thanks to [pyxdf](https://pypi.org/project/pyxdf/)
* BioPAC Acknowledge (acq) thanks to [bioread](https://pypi.org/project/bioread/)
* opensignals ("OpenSignals (r)evolution" thanks to [opensignalsreader](https://github.com/PGomes92/opensignalsreader)
* Biosemi BDF thanks to [pybdf](https://pypi.org/project/pybdf/)
* Generic CSV (where CSV delimiter is automatically inferred and the time column is guessed as well)
* Brams-Bio-Box (in-house format, even though the Generic-CSV functionality should take care of this now)
* hdphysio5 thanks to [hdphysio5](https://github.com/florisvanvugt/hdphysio5)
* TeensyECG (in-house format)
